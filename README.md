## üì¶ Multi-Database Architecture (Polyglot Persistence)

TrendKart leverages a diverse set of databases, each chosen to suit a specific use case and data pattern:

| Type                         | Database                 | Purpose                                                                        |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| üü¶ Relational Database       | **PostgreSQL**           | Core structured data: users, products, orders, cart                            |
| üìÑ Document Store (NoSQL)    | **MongoDB**              | Flexible audit logging and semi-structured activity data                       |
| üîë Key-Value Store (NoSQL)   | **Redis**                | High-speed caching, API rate-limiting, user sessions                           |
| üß± Wide-Column Store (NoSQL) | **Apache Cassandra**     | High-write, scalable tracking of likes, views, and user engagement             |
| üï∏Ô∏è Graph Store (NoSQL)       | **Neo4j**                | Modeling social relationships (follower-following) and product recommendations |
| üîç Search Engine DB          | **Elasticsearch**        | Full-text product/post search with autocomplete and fuzzy matching             |
| ‚è±Ô∏è Time-Series DB            | **InfluxDB**             | Time-based metrics: post analytics, active users over time                     |
| üî• Big Data Processing       | **Apache Spark**         | Batch analysis of user behavior and rule-based homepage recommendations        |

## üß† Design Patterns in Action (Applied Architecture)

TrendKart goes beyond textbook design pattern theory ‚Äî each pattern is applied with purpose, enhancing modularity, scalability, and readability in the backend codebase.

### üß± Creational Patterns
| Pattern            | Use Case                                                                                  |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Singleton**       | Configuration classes, token utilities, Kafka consumers                                  |
| **Factory Method**  | NotificationFactory to create `Email`, `SMS`, `Push` services                            |
| **Abstract Factory**| PaymentGatewayFactory to provide related payment-related services                        |
| **Prototype**       | Scoped beans like `InvoiceBuilder`, `OrderSummaryGenerator` for each request             |
| **Builder**         | `ProductBuilder`, `UserProfileBuilder` ‚Äì to construct objects with optional parameters   |
| **Object Pool**     | Leveraged through connection pooling (HikariCP)                                          |

### üèóÔ∏è Structural Patterns
| Pattern        | Use Case                                                                 |
